    "text": "Summary and Interpretation\nThe examination of King County’s housing market reveals several significant patterns. Properties with higher grade values consistently command higher log_price values. The relationship between sqft_living and log_price is particularly strong in high-grade properties, reflecting the luxury segment of the Seattle market. Analysis of yr_built shows an upward trend in log_price across all grades, influenced by the region’s tech industry growth. Moreover, larger homes (measured by sqft_living) typically correspond to higher grade values, indicating a strong relationship between construction quality and house size."
