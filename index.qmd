Hello, and welcome! I’m Xindi Shan—you can also call me Cindi.

I’m currently a first-year Biostatistics ScM student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, with a budding passion for machine learning and data science. Outside of academics, I’m a travel blogger, sharing my adventures and embracing every moment along the way.
